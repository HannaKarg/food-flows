# food-flows

This study collected data on food flows in the West African cities Tamale (Ghana), Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), Bamako (Mali), and Bamenda (Cameroon) over the course of three seasons. The data was collected primarily on the access roads to the cities and focused on the transportation of food via roadways. Surveys were conducted for one week during peak harvest, lean, and rainy seasons, resulting in a dataset of over 100,000 entries for 46 unprocessed food commodities. The data collected includes information on the type of transportation used, quantity, source, and destination of the food flows. The findings of this study can be used to inform academic and policy discussions on urban food system sustainability and resilience, as well as for validating other datasets.

The dataset is published on zenodo.org. The Jupyter Notebook suggests options for reusing the data. The PostgreSQL folder provides the underlying database structure with auxiliary tables, including calibration lists and metadata (not needed for reusing the published food flow dataset).
